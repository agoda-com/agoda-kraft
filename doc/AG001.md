# AG001: Ignored Return Value Rule

This rule detects instances where return values from function calls 
are ignored, which can lead to potential bugs.

## Description

Ignoring return values often indicates that a function is being called 
solely for its side effects, which can be a code smell. This practice 
can result in:

1. Wasted computation
2. Missed error handling
3. Unexpected behavior

## Noncompliant Code Examples

```kotlin
toUppercase("hello")  // Noncompliant: Return value is ignored
getNumbers().filter { it > 2 }  // Noncompliant: Return value is ignored
userManager.login("user", "password")  // Noncompliant: Return value is ignored
```

## Compliant Code Examples

```kotlin
val uppercased = toUppercase("hello")
val filteredNumbers = getNumbers().filter { it > 2 }
val loginSuccessful = userManager.login("user", "password")
```

## Exceptions

The rule does not flag:
- Functions returning `Unit` or `Nothing`
- Cases where the return value is explicitly ignored using an underscore:

```kotlin
_ = toUppercase("hello")  // Compliant: Explicitly ignored
```
We recognise that sometimes you do want to ignore the return value, 
by making it explicit then we know its not a bug and it's intentional.
